simple blogging software

In order to use, simply copy the Blag folder whereever you want to install it, go into users.php and add your username and a md5 hash of your password, and then just go to the website root.
It currently has the ability to make new notes, however editing can be done easily. Just go into the posts directory, and open the text file of that post. It is based around text files, and has no database.

Generally, you can do whatever you want with it.
